agentsview is a LOCAL-ONLY developer tool. It binds to 127.0.0.1
by default and is not designed for multi-user or public deployment.

Key assumptions reviewers MUST account for:

1. NO AUTHENTICATION NEEDED: All API endpoints are unauthenticated
   by design. The server listens on localhost only. Flagging missing
   auth on any endpoint is a false positive.

2. XSS / SANITIZATION: Markdown rendering uses DOMPurify. The
   {@html renderMarkdown(...)} pattern in Svelte is intentional and
   safe because renderMarkdown() sanitizes via DOMPurify before
   returning HTML. Do not flag this as XSS.

3. RATE LIMITING / DoS: As a local single-user tool, rate limiting
   and concurrency caps are unnecessary. The 10-minute timeout on
   AI CLI generation is intentional. Do not flag missing rate limits.

4. CORS: The CORS policy uses Allow-Origin: * because the embedded
   SPA is served from the same origin. Cross-origin access from
   other local tools is acceptable for a localhost-only service.

5. INPUT VALIDATION: Request body size limits are not required for
   a localhost-only service. Do not flag missing MaxBytesReader or
   similar unless the endpoint is exposed to untrusted networks.

6. SESSION DATA DISPLAY: The tool reads session files from the
   user's own disk and displays their contents (including tool call
   arguments, bash commands, prompts, file paths). This is the
   tool's core purpose. Storing and rendering input_json, commands,
   or other session content is NOT a credential exposure risk —
   the user already has full access to these files. Do not flag
   tool argument storage or display as sensitive data exposure.

7. SCHEMA VERIFICATION: The tool_calls table has an explicit
   `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` column (schema.sql). Do not flag
   ORDER BY id or references to tool_calls.id as missing-column
   errors without verifying the actual schema.

Do NOT flag issues that only apply to public-facing, multi-tenant,
or network-exposed services. Focus on bugs, logic errors, data
corruption risks, and code quality issues.

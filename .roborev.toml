agentsview is a LOCAL-ONLY developer tool. It binds to 127.0.0.1
by default and is not designed for multi-user or public deployment.

Key assumptions reviewers MUST account for:

1. NO AUTHENTICATION NEEDED: All API endpoints are unauthenticated
   by design. The server listens on localhost only. Flagging missing
   auth on any endpoint is a false positive.

2. XSS / SANITIZATION: Markdown rendering uses DOMPurify. The
   {@html renderMarkdown(...)} pattern in Svelte is intentional and
   safe because renderMarkdown() sanitizes via DOMPurify before
   returning HTML. Do not flag this as XSS.

3. RATE LIMITING / DoS: As a local single-user tool, rate limiting
   and concurrency caps are unnecessary. The 10-minute timeout on
   AI CLI generation is intentional. Do not flag missing rate limits.

4. CORS: The CORS policy uses Allow-Origin: * because the embedded
   SPA is served from the same origin. Cross-origin access from
   other local tools is acceptable for a localhost-only service.

5. INPUT VALIDATION: Request body size limits are not required for
   a localhost-only service. Do not flag missing MaxBytesReader or
   similar unless the endpoint is exposed to untrusted networks.

Do NOT flag issues that only apply to public-facing, multi-tenant,
or network-exposed services. Focus on bugs, logic errors, data
corruption risks, and code quality issues.

description: Project inventory and worktree mapping rules
---

The **Data** page is where you inspect and clean project classification across
the whole archive. It is the home of the worktree mapping rules that previously
lived in the Settings **Worktree mappings** section.

Open it from the **Data** tab in the header, or follow a project link from the
[Activity breakdown](/docs/activity/#breakdowns). Deep links are stable:
`/data?project_key=<key>` selects a project, and `/data?view=rules` opens the
[Rules view](#rules).

## Project Inventory

The default view lists every project in the archive with its session, machine,
agent, and working-directory counts plus first and last activity timestamps. A
summary strip totals the projects, sessions, and the sessions currently governed
by classification rules.

- The table is sortable by any column and filterable by project name.
- Projects targeted by enabled rules carry a rule badge; projects recorded as a
  rule's original label carry an original-label badge.
- Sessions whose stored project label is empty are grouped under a single
  "unknown" row.
- Activity bounds come from session timestamps only; rows without any recorded
  timestamps show a no-activity state.

Selecting a row opens the project workspace. Unknown `project_key` deep links
show the full inventory with a non-blocking notice.

## Create A Project Mapping

The workspace creates
[worktree project mappings](/docs/configuration/#worktree-project-mappings)
directly:

- **Observed folders** lists every session folder associated with the selected
  project. Each folder stays visible instead of being hidden behind a worktree
  selector.
- Selecting a folder opens one mapping row: **Folder path → Project**. The
  suggested folder path covers that group's working directories and remains
  editable, so it can be shortened to cover sibling folders when appropriate.
- The **Project** typeahead suggests known projects and accepts a new name. When
  the server normalizes the name (for example `sample-service` becomes
  `sample_service`), the editor shows the stored form before you apply.
- The **full archive impact** preview is live and authoritative: it counts
  matching sessions across all dates for that machine. A prefix that touches
  more than one existing project shows a warning with per-project counts —
  usually a sign the prefix is too broad. A prefix matching zero sessions
  cannot be applied.

**Save and apply mapping** saves the rule and rewrites the matching sessions in
one atomic step, then reloads the inventory. If the applied rule renamed the
selected project, the selection follows the new name. If mappings changed
between preview and apply, the apply is rejected and a fresh preview is
required.

## Rules

The **Rules** toggle shows the worktree mapping rules for one machine at a time,
with the same add, edit, apply, and delete controls that Settings previously
offered — see
[Worktree Project Mappings](/docs/configuration/#worktree-project-mappings) for
the full rule semantics. Each rule row also shows its **governed sessions**
count (how many sessions the rule currently classifies) and the **original
label** recorded when the rule was created through the mapping editor. Rule
targets link back to the corresponding inventory row.

## Read-Only Servers

On a read-only server (`pg serve` or `duckdb serve`) the inventory, the
candidate evidence, and the Rules table remain fully readable, but the editor
and rule mutations are replaced by a notice: classification rules are managed
from the writable archive that ingests the machine's sessions.

## Storage maintenance

The local archive has four separate maintenance paths:

- `agentsview db compact` reclaims SQLite free pages and truncates the WAL. It
  preserves all live rows and has no effect on future tool-result growth.
- `result_content_blocked_categories` followed by `agentsview sync --full`
  applies the current result filtering to source-backed sessions that can be
  reparsed. Orphaned and trashed sessions whose source files are gone cannot
  be filtered this way.
- [`archive_content`](/docs/configuration/#archive-content) followed by a daemon
  restart and `agentsview sync --full` applies a whole-archive storage policy.
  Unlike category filtering, the rebuild also projects orphaned and trashed
  sessions onto the policy, so dropped tool payloads or transcript text leave
  the archive entirely.
- Transparent compression or deduplication of live tool-result payloads is a
  separate storage-format change and is not part of `db compact`.

Compaction and full resync share the archive maintenance barrier, and the daemon
enforces it: a compaction requested while a sync, resync, or another compaction
is running fails immediately with a conflict rather than queueing. The compact
command reports the database, WAL, SHM, freelist, staging requirement, and final
reclaimed bytes separately; its result must not be combined with savings from
filtering or a future compression implementation. See
[`agentsview db compact`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-db-compact) for the staging
space model and interrupted-compaction recovery.

# Performance Gates

agentsview has repeatedly shipped performance regressions where sync work
stopped scaling with *new data* and started scaling with *archive size*. This
document records the regression classes we have actually hit, and the gates that
now guard each one. When you touch a sync or DB hot path, know which gate covers
you; when you fix a new class of regression, add a gate here.

The watcher scheduler, bounded watcher batches, and Codex continuation cursor
contracts are documented in
[Background Sync Efficiency](background-sync-efficiency.md).

## Regression history

| Class                          | What happened                                                                                                                                                                                           | Fixed in                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Discovery O(sources) root work | Gemini rebuilt its project map per session; positron/vscode-copilot re-read `workspace.json` per session. A large store spent 2m47s in discovery.                                                       | #912                                           |
| Unchanged sources reparsed     | The provider migration dropped pre-parse DB-freshness skips; every full sync reparsed and rewrote untouched sessions.                                                                                   | `providerSourceUnchangedInDB` (#883 follow-up) |
| O(history) incremental appends | Every streamed line ran a full signal recompute (reload all messages, secret regex scan) and chunk merges delete+reinserted every message row. ~4,700 session updates/day each paid O(session history). | #954                                           |
| Bulk ingest throughput         | Full resync ran per-row inserts and rebuilt FTS incrementally; 26.7k sessions took 1m17s.                                                                                                               | #411                                           |
| Event storms                   | One SSE emit per watcher flush drove ~1/s dashboard refetch; SQLite WAL sidecar events fanned out to every session in a shared DB.                                                                      | #367, #956                                     |
| Per-row query shape            | `GetDailyUsage` ran 1.2M `json_extract` calls per scan and had no date pushdown.                                                                                                                        | #309                                           |
| Usage archive scaling          | Normalized facts removed JSON parsing but warm requests still ranked and priced hundreds of thousands of rows instead of reading daily aggregates.                                                      | Usage aggregate cache                          |

## Two layers of gates

### 1. Deterministic work-count invariants (run in `make test`)

These count work units instead of measuring time, so they are immune to CI
runner noise and fail loudly:

- `TestWarmFullSyncDoesNoBulkWriteWork` (`internal/sync/perf_invariant_test.go`)
  — a second full sync over an unchanged Claude archive must skip everything
  and run zero bulk-write batches (`Engine.PhaseStats`).
- `TestProviderAuthoritativeUnchangedSessionSkipsOnResync`
  (`internal/sync/provider_freshness_integration_test.go`) — the generic
  freshness skip for provider-authoritative agents, Vibe as representative.
- `TestWriteIncrementalDebouncesSignalRecompute` and the rest of
  `internal/sync/signal_schedule_test.go` — streaming appends must debounce
  the O(history) signal recompute.
- The count-based seam tests in `internal/parser`
  (`discovery_workspace_manifest_test.go`, gemini/antigravity provider tests)
  — root-derived project info is built once per root, not once per source.
- `internal/server/broadcaster_test.go` — SSE emits coalesce to at most one
  broadcast per window.
- `TestWatcherBatchesPathsAndEnforcesDispatchFloor`,
  `TestWatcherSustainedWritesProgress`,
  `TestWatcherContinuesIntakeDuringCallback`, and
  `TestWatcherOverflowRunsFullSyncThenRetainsLaterBatch`
  (`internal/sync/watcher_test.go`) — watcher callbacks remain throttled and
  serialized, sustained writes make progress, event intake continues during a
  sync, and an event storm becomes a bounded full rescan.
- `TestCodexCursorCache`, `TestCodexCursorWarmColdParity`, and the cursor
  boundary tests in `internal/parser` — continuation state stays bounded and
  warm/cold parsing remains equivalent at safe offsets.
- `TestIncrementalSync_CodexAppend`,
  `TestIncrementalSync_CodexLifecycleTailUpdatesTermination`, the partial-tail
  tests, and the late-update/title tests in
  `internal/sync/engine_integration_test.go` — safe Codex growth appends only
  new rows while lifecycle metadata, incomplete records, title changes, and
  retroactive updates preserve full-parse behavior.
- `TestCountDuplicatePromptsAllocationGrowthStaysNearLinear`
  (`internal/signals/heuristics_test.go`) — session-quality analysis must not
  rebuild token sets for every pair of user prompts.

When you fix a performance bug, prefer adding a gate at this layer: expose or
reuse a counter (`SyncStats`, `PhaseStats`, `AnomalyStats`, a swappable
package-var seam) and assert the invariant, e.g. "second sync parses zero
sessions" or "the manifest is read once per root regardless of session count".

### 2. Benchmark gate (runs on every PR via `bench.yml`)

`.github/workflows/bench.yml` runs `make bench-gate` — the single source of
truth for the gated package list, sample count, and per-tier iteration counts —
on the PR head and its merge base on the same runner, then compares the outputs
with `cmd/benchgate`:

- `BenchmarkSyncAllWarmNoop` — full sync over an already-synced archive (stat +
  skip work only; also self-asserts nothing is re-synced or bulk-rewritten).
- `BenchmarkSyncPathsIncrementalAppend` — absorb one appended line into a
  1,000-message session.
- `BenchmarkCodexIncrementalSyncReads` — a warm Codex cursor append plus the
  remaining full-source fingerprint and committed-prefix hash reads. See
  [Background Sync Efficiency](background-sync-efficiency.md) for the
  cost-model boundary.
- `BenchmarkSyncAllColdArchive` — first-sync ingest throughput through the
  default per-session write path.
- `BenchmarkResyncBulkIngest` — the same archive through the resync bulk-write
  pipeline (`writeBatchBulk` / `DB.WriteSessionBatch`, the #411 regression
  class); self-asserts every session took the batch path.
- `BenchmarkReplaceSessionMessagesStreamingMerge` — the streaming chunk-merge
  diff path (one UPDATE, not a full delete+reinsert).
- `BenchmarkInsertMessagesBatch` — multi-row batched ingest.
- `BenchmarkResyncBulkContributorIngest` — the same archive entering the atomic
  rebuild through a contributor engine.
- `BenchmarkSearchContentSubstringPage` / `BenchmarkSearchContentFTSPage` — one
  page of content search through the substring and FTS paths.
- `BenchmarkPersistUnchangedSkipCache` — repeated persistence of an unchanged
  10k-entry skip cache must avoid copying the map and rewriting its rows.
- `BenchmarkGetStats` — the repeatedly polled sidebar totals over 10k sessions.
  Computes all totals together so a refresh scans filtered sessions once.
- `BenchmarkGetDailyUsage` — usage aggregation over 100k message rows. The usage
  aggregate implementation keeps this benchmark name so the gate compares it
  with the merge-base request path. Its warm cases must scan no normalized
  facts and scale with aggregate plus exceptional rows.
- `BenchmarkSQLiteActivityReportCandidateSource100K`,
  `BenchmarkSQLiteActivityReportCandidateSourceLongSession`, and
  `BenchmarkSQLiteActivityReportArtifacts100K` — activity-report candidate
  streaming and artifact building over 100k sessions or a 100k-message
  session.
- `BenchmarkScan` / `BenchmarkScanDefinite` — secret-scan regex throughput.
- `BenchmarkCountDuplicatePromptsLargeSession` — duplicate-prompt analysis over
  a long session with shared vocabulary and distinct prompt context.

`benchgate` builds on `golang.org/x/perf`: `benchfmt` parses the output and
`benchmath` — the statistics engine behind `benchstat` — summarizes samples and
tests significance (Mann-Whitney U). benchgate adds only the policy benchstat
does not provide: thresholds, floors, and a failing exit code. Gating is per
benchmark — any single benchmark over its threshold fails the PR; nothing is
averaged across benchmarks. It gates hard on `allocs/op` (limit 1.25x), which is
deterministic for the same code and iteration count — an
O(archive)-instead-of-O(delta) regression always blows it up. It compares the
candidate's *worst* `-count` run against the baseline median, so even an
intermittent extra-allocation path fails. That is intentionally asymmetric: the
baseline is treated as the historical reference, and candidate instability is
what blocks the PR (failure lines include the baseline's worst run so
pre-existing instability is visible). `B/op` keeps a tight 1.35x limit but
compares medians and must be a statistically significant difference before it
fails. Allocated bytes are not deterministic once the code under test reuses
pooled buffers: `encoding/json` keeps its encoder buffers in a per-processor
`sync.Pool`, so whether a `Marshal` call re-allocates a multi-hundred-kilobyte
buffer depends on which processor the goroutine lands on. The recall evidence
window benchmarks showed this in CI with identical code, spreading `B/op` from
3.6 to 7.9 MiB across five runs while `allocs/op` moved by under one percent.
Time (`sec/op`) compares medians with a loose 2.0x limit and the same
significance requirement, so a single slow run on a noisy runner cannot flake a
PR but algorithmic blowups still do. Significance gating requires at least 5
candidate samples; fewer is reported as a configuration error (the candidate run
is under the workflow's control), while a baseline with fewer than 5 samples — a
legitimately partial base run — is reported and not gated. Baselines below a
per-metric floor are not gated. Benchmarks that exist on only one side are
reported but never fail, so adding or removing benchmarks cannot wedge a PR.
Only `allocs/op`, `B/op`, and `sec/op` are gated: custom `b.ReportMetric` units
are collected and reported as ungated, never enforced.

Two failure modes are treated as loud configuration errors (exit 2) rather than
silent gaps: a capture whose result lines fail to parse, and a gated unit
present in the baseline but missing from the candidate (for example a candidate
captured without `-benchmem`), which would otherwise silently disable that gate
for good. The reverse — a gated unit missing from the baseline, which may
legitimately be older or partial — is reported as not gated.

There is one corruption source we have actually hit. `go test` gives the test
binary a single merged stdout+stderr pipe, and the testing package prints a
benchmark's name before the timed loop and its numbers after, so any log line
the code under test writes in between (the slow `InsertMessages` warning during
fixture seeding on a busy runner, for example) splits the result across two
lines. benchfmt cannot parse either half, the sample disappears, and the gate
fails on the corruption or on having too few samples. Benchmarks therefore send
the package logger through their own `b.Output()`, which the testing package
prints after the result line: `testDB` does it for every `internal/db`
benchmark, and the sync benchmarks call `routeBenchLogs`.

The gate always runs with a fixed `-benchtime=Nx` iteration count (not a
duration): two of the benchmarks grow their fixture as they iterate, so the
baseline and candidate must run the same number of iterations to measure
identical workloads. Iterations come in two tiers. Benchmarks whose single
iteration costs hundreds of milliseconds to seconds (the 100k-row usage and
activity-report fixtures and cold-archive ingest, matched by `BENCH_GATE_HEAVY`)
run in a second `go test` pass with `BENCH_GATE_HEAVY_TIME` iterations; every
other benchmark runs with `BENCH_GATE_TIME`. Per-op ratios at that scale do not
need the averaging that millisecond-scale samples do, and at the full iteration
count those few benchmarks were most of the gate's wall clock.
`BENCH_GATE_COUNT` samples are taken per benchmark, and every sample rebuilds
the fixture, so the count is kept at benchgate's significance minimum. CI
evaluates `make bench-gate-config` on the PR head and passes the count, both
iteration counts, and the heavy-tier regex into the merge-base run, so a PR that
changes those defaults still compares identical workloads; do the same locally
if you override them.

Report identifiers are package-qualified benchmark names
(`go.kenn.io/agentsview/internal/db.InsertMessagesBatch-18`) when the captured
output carries `pkg:` metadata, falling back to the bare name when it does not
(e.g. hand-trimmed captures). Do not mix captures with and without `pkg:` lines:
the same benchmark would key differently and be treated as removed/new.

Run locally, comparing your working tree against a baseline commit. Like CI, use
a worktree for the baseline — checking out or stashing in place can leave
candidate files (or your commits) in the baseline run:

```bash
make bench-gate > new.txt                # candidate: current tree
git worktree add /tmp/bench-base "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)"
make -C /tmp/bench-base bench-gate > old.txt
git worktree remove /tmp/bench-base
go run ./cmd/benchgate -old old.txt -new new.txt
```

Cross-backend query benchmarks live separately in `internal/backendbench`
(`make bench-backends`, requires Docker) and are not part of the PR gate.

## Usage aggregate release gates

CI uses fixture-based work invariants and benchmark ratios. Machine-specific
targets are manual release gates on the protected production-scale clone. Run
them after cache statistics maintenance so planner state does not exaggerate the
aggregate tier's benefit.

- Complete warm 30-day CLI result: at most two seconds.
- Warm in-process 30-day result: target 1.5 seconds.
- Report warm 1-day, 7-day, 30-day, and all-history results.
- Report cold timezone/component construction and steady-state rebuild
  throughput separately.
- Report exception group and row counts plus exception-resolution time for
  30-day and all-history reads.
- Newest-first facts plus process-local rollups: complete within 30 seconds.
- Full facts plus process-local rollup coverage: complete within five minutes.

The detailed architecture and oracle requirements are in
[Usage Aggregate Cache](usage-aggregate-cache.md).

`BenchmarkCodexIncrementalCursor` lives in `internal/parser` and compares cold
prefix reconstruction with an exact warm cursor. It is diagnostic rather than
PR-gated: `BENCH_GATE_PACKAGES` currently contains `./internal/sync`,
`./internal/db`, `./internal/secrets`, and `./internal/signals`.

## Adding a benchmark to the gate

Every benchmark in a gated package is gated — there is no per-name allowlist to
maintain. A benchmark added by a PR has no baseline, so its first run is
reported without gating; it gates automatically once merged.

1. Write the benchmark next to the code it guards (`*_bench_test.go`,
   `b.ReportAllocs()`, self-assert the invariant it protects where possible).
   Anything the code under test logs must go through the benchmark's own
   output (`testDB` does this for `internal/db`; see `routeBenchLogs` in
   `internal/sync/engine_bench_test.go` for the pattern). A log line written
   straight to stderr mid-result corrupts the capture and benchgate fails on
   it.
1. If its package is not already gated, add it to `BENCH_GATE_PACKAGES` in the
   Makefile — a benchmark outside the gated packages silently never runs, so
   it looks gated while measuring nothing. CI picks the list up from the
   Makefile; each side of the comparison benchmarks its own commit's list, so
   growing the gate cannot break the base run.
1. Keep per-op cost roughly in the 100µs–100ms band: below the benchgate floors
   nothing is gated, and far above it the job gets slow. A benchmark that
   needs a large fixture to expose per-row scaling belongs in
   `BENCH_GATE_HEAVY` so it runs with the reduced iteration count; a
   fixture-growing benchmark does not, because its per-op cost depends on the
   iteration count. Keep fixture seeding cheap too: it is repeated once per
   `-count` sample.
1. Keep per-iteration setup out of the timed region (`b.ResetTimer`, pre-built
   fixtures): helper allocations inside the loop are gated as if they were
   product cost and dilute or distort the ratio.
1. If the benchmark's fixture grows across iterations, say so in its comment;
   the fixed `-benchtime=Nx` keeps both sides comparable, but readers need to
   know per-op cost depends on the iteration count.

## Synthetic workload simulator

`make perf-sim` runs the retained simulator in `cmd/perfsim`. See
[the simulator guide](performance-simulator.md) for archive-size comparisons,
append-only profiles, and analytic-query measurements. Its small correctness
fixture runs in the normal Go suite. Large runs are opt-in; their process-wide
allocation samples include background work and are not CI timing assertions.

`BenchmarkCodexStreamingDiscovery` in `internal/parser` is a diagnostic
benchmark, like `BenchmarkCodexIncrementalCursor`, outside the default gate
package list. The sync candidate-lookup and unchanged-cache work regressions
also run as deterministic tests in the regular suite.

The simulator's `--source-format opencode` mode covers SQLite metadata and
full-digest scans, active-session polling, container events, and child-only part
edits. `TestOpenCodeVirtualEventDoesNotRecheckUnrelatedMembers` bounds unchanged
virtual-event work as the archive grows and checks deletion behavior.
